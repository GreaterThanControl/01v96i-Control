01v96i-Control
==============

This is the code to get a Yamaha 01v96i to work with TouchOSC. It is largely written in MaxMSP

The code is a bot of a mess but we have decided to make this open source to help others. The program as of 1/1/13 generally works but needs a front end. There is a significant amount if testing and tweaking to get done to make this really useable.
I would be happy to help any one who is interested in picking this up.
